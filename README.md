# Ouroboros-Android-Game
This is a simple android game I developed when I was 16 in 2017. I used Android Studio as an IDE, LIBGDX as a game engine, and Java as a programming language (Kotlin was just given support on Android Studio at the time). All assets were created by me aside from the sound effects and fonts. Photoshop and fl studio were used to create graphics and music.

This is a simple android game I developed when I was 16 in 2017. I used Android Studio as an IDE, LIBGDX as a game engine, and Java as a programming language (Kotlin was just given support in Android Studio at the time). All assets were created by me aside from the sound effects and fonts. Photoshop and fl studio were used to create graphics and music. After Effects was used for the accompanied video. This was made for a high school art class in which each student was given 2 months to complete a project of choice.
